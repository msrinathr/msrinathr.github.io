Easiest and quick way was to use CMS like Wordpress, this requires a server. Wordpress has lot of features and add-ons to use. For me blog is mostly static posts, you don’t need server to host a static site. Just waste of resources. I started looking at famous static site generators like Hugo, Hexo, Jekyll, Pelican. Then I found Gatsby, it’s a React based static site generator.</p>\n<p>I will guide you with below steps:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Setting up Gatsby</li>\n<li>Adding a theme</li>\n<li>Creating a new post</li>\n<li>Push blog to GitHub</li>\n<li>Host blog on GitHub Pages</li>\n<li>Redirect GitHub Pages to a custom domain</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Refer: <a href=\"https://gatsbyjs.org/\">https://gatsbyjs.org/</a></p>\n<p>Install Gatsby on you local machine, you can use existing starters for quickstart or build website from scratch. I used lumen starter from gatsby central and modified it a little.\nWatch this 4 hour <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t0vNu2fCCM\">bootcamp lesson</a> by Andrew Mead to understand gatsby, react.</p>\n<p>Once you have developed your gatsby site. Head over to github and create a repository as gitusername.github.io  and push your site code to this repo. Optionally you can add your custom domain name to the repo.</p>\n<p>If you have any questions or need help in creating your gatsby site contact me.</p>","fields":{"tagSlugs":["/tags/web-development/","/tags/gatsby/"],"slug":"/posts/creating-my-blog-using-gatsby-react/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Creating My Blog Using Gatsby-React","tags":["Web Development","Gatsby"],"date":"2018-04-27T13:10:00.121Z","description":"I will guide you how to create your blog in using gatsby-react and publish posts with very less effort and use markdown, git or AWS S3 to host blog."}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/posts/creating-my-blog-using-gatsby-react/"}}}
